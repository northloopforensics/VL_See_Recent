# VL_See_Recent
Retrieves recent file access from VLC configuration file

This executable is intended for use with KAPE. The relevant Target and Module (tkape & mkape) files are available here as well.

The tool can be used standalone by using the following commandline arguments

VL_See_Recent.exe InputFolder OutputFolder

VL_See_Recent.exe C: "E:\Report Directory"

Input Folder - the tool treats this input as the volume letter. It then appends "\\Users\\" to the volume letter and walks all lower directories looking for the vlc-qt-interface.ini file for all users on the system.

Output Folder - the storage directory to receive the report generated by the tool.
